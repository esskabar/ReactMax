# React Max theme
A WordPress theme using React 16, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack 3.

I intend to continue developing the project by building the Next Steps of the article in the **'next-steps'** branch.

The following pre-requisites should be in place for the theme to work:

1. WordPress version 4.7 or later
2. Posts permalink set set to: Custom Structure - /posts/%postname%/
3. Products permalink to be set as: Custom base - /products/

Installing and beginning development
------------------------------------

1. git clone https://github.com/esskabar/ReactMax.git
2. cd react-max
3. npm install
4. webpack
5. Head over to Appearances > Themes in your WordPress Dashboard and Select 'react-max'
6. Install bootstrap 4.0.0
npm install --save bootstrap@4.0.0
